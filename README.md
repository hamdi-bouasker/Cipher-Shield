# Cipher Shield

I coded it from the scratch with C# and it's heavily tested for a flawless usability and functionality.

Cipher Shield is a robust and secure solution designed to handle all your password and file management needs. It includes a password generator, password manager, file encryption using **AES-GCM with Argon2id**, and regex-based file renaming. 
With Cipher Shield, you can ensure that your sensitive data remains protected at all times.

**AES-GCM with Argon2id** is an encryption algorithm wich provides confidentiality + authenticity.

This type of encryption is known for its speed and security, making it a preferred choice for many organizations, including the U.S. government.

When you launch the app for the first time, you will be asked to register a password and security questions which are used to recover the Lock Password and the password used during files encryption.

When login, you have the possibility to load the lock password by loading the **Lock-Password.dat** file which you already saved in the Help tab.

It's also possible to recover your password and load it directly in the login tab by correctly answering **the security questions** you already registered during the app's first launch.

## Features

- **Password Generator:** Generates complex and secure passwords to enhance security using **Fisher–Yates shuffle** with **secure RNG**.

- **Password Manager:** Securely saves passwords to the database using **SQLCipher**.
- An Entry is composed of: Website, Username or Email address and Passsword.
- You can Add, Update and Delete an entry. You can Export as csv file or print them.

- **File Encryption:** Files are encrypted using the **AES-GCM with Argon2id** encryption algorithm.
- 
  * When decrypting: read salt & nonce, derive key, decrypt with tag verification. If verification fails, fail and delete partial output.
 
- Advantages of using **AesGcm with Argon2id**:
  
  * Memory-hard, GPU-resistant (Argon2id)
  * AES-GCM (authenticated encryption)
  * Random salt + nonce for each file
  * Clear key after use

- **How passwords are saved?**
 
- The passwords are saved and encrypted with **DPAPI algorithm**:
  
  * **DPAPI** ties the encryption to the user account.
  * Only the same user on the same system can decrypt the data.
  * Strong AES encryption handled by Windows.
  * Automatically unique to each user account.
  * Works even if someone copies your .dat file — they can’t decrypt it on another PC.

- **Regex File Rename:** Renames files using C# regex symbols for flexible and powerful file naming.

- **Help:** Change your password or the answers of your security questions anytime.
  You can also save the Lock Password so next time you can login easily by clicking on Load Password.
  Lock-Password.dat file is securely encrypted using **DPAPI algorithm**.

## Advantages of Encrypting Sensitive Data

Encrypting sensitive data is crucial for maintaining privacy and security in today's digital world. Here are some key advantages:

- **Data Protection:** Encryption ensures that your data remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access. Even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the encryption key.
- **Compliance:** Encryption helps meet regulatory requirements and standards for data protection, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS, ensuring your organization stays compliant.
- **Integrity and Anthenticity:** Encryption protects data integrity by preventing tampering or alteration. Any unauthorized changes to the data can be detected, ensuring the authenticity of the information.
- **Trust:** Encrypting sensitive data fosters trust with your users, clients, and partners, demonstrating your commitment to safeguarding their information.
- **Resilience:** Encrypted data is less vulnerable to cyber-attacks, such as hacking, phishing, and data breaches, providing an additional layer of security.
